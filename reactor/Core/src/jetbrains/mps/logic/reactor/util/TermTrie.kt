/**
 * A map-like structure to keep multiple values associated with a single term.
 *
 * The method `put` updates the structure to contain the new association. Likewise, the method
 * `remove` updates it to remove the association. Both methods return the same trie object to
 * make the API compatible with the persistent version of the same structure.
 *
 * Term variables are supported: a variable matches any term, including other variable. All variables are treated
 * as "wildcards", so the subsequent unification of the query term and the key does not necessarily succeeds.
 *
 * To access the stored values, the method `lookupValues` returns all values associated with terms.
 * The method `allValues` returns all stored values. Neither method makes any guarantees about the cardinality or
 * the order of the values returned.
