# INSTALL #

Prerequisites:

- JDK 11 
- Maven 3

** NOTE: ** in order to open any of the sample projects follow the steps below
for building the whole project, as samples expect the compiled languages to be
available in a project library.

## Necessary step to execute *before* everything else

Recommended way: use one of the "just" recipes in justfile. For more info on "just" utility
visit https://github.com/casey/just.

This downloads all the dependencies:

  ./gradlew -b dependencies.gradle

## To fully build the project including all subprojects, execute: ##

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -f reactor install && ./gradlew assemble

## To fully build and test the project including all subprojects, execute: ##

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -f reactor install && ./gradlew check

This builds the "reactor" project and installs its artefacts into local Maven
repository. Then the regular Gradle build is launched. Further launches of
Gradle can be done without running the build in "reactor".

The default task to execute if none is specified is "assemble".

## To install all the dependencies in order to open the project with MPS: ##

    mvn -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -B -f reactor install && ./gradlew setup

Once the project is opened, execute "Rebuild Project", since generated
artefacts are excluded from version control.
